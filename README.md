## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- With uneven rows it's best to stick with grid and format the html accordingly. Even though my approach of having 1 row and 3 columns with 3 grid child elements worked, I couldn't achieve a 2x2 layout for tablet view because of the second child div inside the grid defining the height of the row. This left what seemed like an "empty gap."

### Continued development

- A more nuanced understanding of css grid.
